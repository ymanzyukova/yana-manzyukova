            <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
            <p>My name is Yana Manzyukova and this is my personal webiste used to showcase my skills and expierences. I am a full time student at Toronto Metropolitain University and I'm also in the Ted Rogers co-op program. I'm in my 5th year and even became a co-op mentor. My current studies alongside my internships have created an interest in technology assisting financial needs of a company. I am particularly interested in how a business analyst uses technology to analyze a stock's history to determine what is best to do with it. My experience from Scotiabank has introduced me to Bloomberg, Excel, SQL, and Tableau, showing mw how they are used to make financial reports for the company. Through this internship I have compared and interpreted both programs and the different ways they use to determine whether to buy, sell, or hold the stock. With the assistance of these programs, I assisted a business analyst compiled the information in excel for a weekly financial report to be presented to managers. </p>
